# movie-trailers
This is a basic site incorporating server-side script to allow users to play movie trailers when the respective posters are selected.
I've used Python in this program to power the web page, and also to allow the user to watch the trailer of the clicked poster.
All you need is to save the files in the same folder and load up the html file in your browser.

Styling achieved using inline CSS and JavaScript.
